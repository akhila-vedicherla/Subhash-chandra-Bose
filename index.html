    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose (also called Netaji) is known for his role in India’s independence movement. A participant of the noncooperation movement and a leader of the Indian National Congress, he was part of the more militant wing and known for his advocacy of socialist policies.</p>
    <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose studied in Calcutta (Kolkata) at the Presidency College and the Scottish Churches College. His parents then sent him to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. He passed the civil service examination but resigned his candidacy and returned to India after hearing of nationalist turmoils there.</p>
    <h3>IMPACTS</h3>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose (known also as Netaji) reflected a more militant and socialist approach to India’s independence movement as compared with Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s less confrontational stance and more conservative economics. While in exile in the 1940s, Bose raised a liberation army in East Asia with Japanese aid and influence.</p>
    <h3>DEATH</h3>
    <P>Subhas Chandra Bose reportedly died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan from burn injuries on August 18, 1945, as a result of a plane crash while fleeing Southeast Asia, days after World War II ended with the surrender of Japan (which had been supporting Bose and his liberation army).</P>
